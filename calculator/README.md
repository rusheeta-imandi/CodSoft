# Basic Calculator

This is a simple calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It features an interactive interface with a display screen and buttons for each digit and operator.

## Features

- **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division Operations**: Perform basic arithmetic calculations.
- **Interactive Interface**: Buttons for input, an area for displaying results, and a clear button.
- **Responsive Layout**: CSS Grid is used to align buttons neatly.

## File Structure

The project is organized into the following structure for ease of navigation and maintainability:
    ```bash
    
    calculator/
    ├── index.html               # Main HTML file for the calculator interface
    ├── css/
    │   └── style.css            # Styles for the calculator
    ├── js/
    │   └── script.js            # JavaScript to handle logic for the calculator  
    └── README.md                # Documentation for the project


## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd calculator
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the calculator.

## JavaScript Functionality
  - **Event Listeners**: Each button triggers an event listener that handles the user's input.
  - **Operations**: The script executes the corresponding arithmetic operation based on user input (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
  - **Display Update**: The display area updates with the current input or the result of a calculation.

## Functions:
  - `handleClick()`: Handles the click event and updates the input.
  - `executeOperation()`: Executes the operation when the `=` button is clicked.
  - `add()`, `subtract()`, `multiply()`, `divide()`: Perform the corresponding arithmetic operations.
  - `displayInput()`: Updates the display with the current input or result.

## Usage
1. Click the number buttons to input digits.
2. Use the operator buttons (`+`, `-`, `x`, `÷`) to choose the operation.
3. Click the `=` button to calculate and display the result.
4. Click `C` to clear the current input.
